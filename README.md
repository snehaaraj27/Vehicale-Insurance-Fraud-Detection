Vehicale Insurance Fraud Detection
Key Steps and Analyses
Data Preprocessing: Initially, I performed data preprocessing tasks, including handling missing values and data cleaning. This ensured the dataset was ready for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I conducted extensive EDA to gain insights into the data, including summary statistics and visualizations. This step provided a better understanding of the distribution of variables and potential patterns related to fraud cases.

Data Visualization: Various data visualization techniques were employed, such as histograms and bar plots, to depict the distribution of specific features and identify any potential correlations or anomalies.

Predictive Modeling: Using the Random Forest Classifier, I built a predictive model to identify potential fraudulent cases based on the provided dataset. The model was trained and evaluated to assess its performance in detecting fraudulent activities accurately.

Cross-Validation and Parameter Tuning: Cross-validation techniques were applied to assess the model's generalizability, and model hyperparameters were fine-tuned to optimize its performance and enhance its predictive capabilities.

Data Interpretation: Feature importance analysis was conducted to identify the key factors influencing potential fraud cases. These insights were utilized to develop effective strategies for preventing and mitigating fraudulent activities.

Data Security and Compliance: Throughout the analysis, data security protocols were adhered to strictly to ensure the protection of sensitive customer information and compliance with relevant data protection regulations.
